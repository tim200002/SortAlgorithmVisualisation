# SortAlgorithmVisualisation
 
 Little Project to Visualize some of the most Common Sorting Algorithms.
 Code may be a bit ugly because I had no further experience in HTML. Whole Project was leraning by doing.
 
Algorithms to Visualize:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort -> Algorithm works but Visualizsation not so good at the Moment

Here are a few pictures:
